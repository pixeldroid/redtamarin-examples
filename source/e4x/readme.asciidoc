= e4x examples

tamarin supports the same e4x syntax found in actionscript3.

=== basic concepts:
- `.` dot operator selects children by name
- `..` double dot operator selects children by name at any depth
- `.@` at operator selects attribute by name
- `.()` parentheses allow insertion of custom boolean filters

selectors return XMLList values, which have function-style properties (e.g. `length()`),
and can be numerically indexed like an Array with the `[]` operator.
